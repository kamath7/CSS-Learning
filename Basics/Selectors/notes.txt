Multiple classes - div class="class1 class2" and a class="active" -> a.active{...}

CSS Class selector vs ID selectors - 
Difference in syntax (. vs #)
CSS Class is reusable. CSS class allows you to mark and name things for styling purposes only. Most used selector type
ID used only once per page. Also got non-CSS meaning (on-page link).IDs are to be used only if available

!important overwrites specificity and all other selectors. Not a good thing to use. 
not pseudo class aids in excluding a selector
