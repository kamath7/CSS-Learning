1in = 2.54cm
Browser is able to identify hardware size but will convert the website to be cluttered

Viewport meta tag- Make device consider software pixel rather than hardware pixel

We have two tools to make site responsive
a) ViewPort b) MEdia Queries

ViewPort -

No design changes 

Media Queries
Change design depending on size
Design changes defined by user

Media queries are to be ordered as per the ascending order
