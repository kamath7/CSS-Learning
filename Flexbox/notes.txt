Property - 
display: flex /Parent is the flex container. Flex items are the children (child elements)
flex containers also have properties like flex-flow, justify-content, align-content and align-items 
flex items have properties such as order, flex, align-self

flex-wrap - wrap-reverse -
flex-direction: column - behaves the same way display: block

main axis vs cross axis 
flex-direction: row along the main axis and from left to right 
flex-direction: row-reverse along the main axis and from right to left
flex-direction: column starting point is the same as row. Main axis is from top to bottom and cross axis left to right. 
flex-direction: column starting point is the same as row. Main axis is from top to bottom and cross axis right to left. 

flew-flow : shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap
align-items - default value is stretch

align -items
flex-direction: row applied 
for case of flexdirection row: justify-content - positioning along main axis and align-items positioning along cross axis 

flew-direction: column applied 
for case of flexdirection column: justify-content positioning along main axis (column) and align items positioning along main axis (row)

align-content: combination of align-items and justify-content
  
order: 1;/*default value for order is 0 */ and order:-1 will position it in front

align-self - aligned across the cross axis 

flex-grow: 0 /*initial value 0 */
flex-shrink: 1;/*initial value 1 */
if flex-shrink is 0 it won't let shrink lesser than it's width

flex basis defines size of element dependent on main axis. 
if flex-basis is auto, then width if flex-direction row else it will be height if flex-direction column
