Keyframes:
Keyframes- Define animation tsteps. Via from and to or % values 
Animate as many props as you want 
Animate different properties in each keyframe step 
timing FUNCTION interpolates transition between keyframe 

Animation :
Set duration and delayDefine how many iterations should be played
Animation0fill0mode - properties of last keyframe should be kept or not
