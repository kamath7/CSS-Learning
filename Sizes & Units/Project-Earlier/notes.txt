How is size calculated

Absolute Lengths (px,cm,mm)

On a monitor 1cm!=1cm.

Viewport Lengths
Adjust to current viewport 
vh, vw,vmin, vmax

Adjust to default font size 
rem,em 

Another category is %

How the box size for % units calculated?

Rules to rember : Fixed positioning & %
a) Element - for position:fixed - reference point is containing block. Element changes to viewport 
b) Position absolute - refers to ancestors content + padding 
c) Position static or position relative - Refers to ancestors content only

em calculated based on actual size of element and the font size of the browser
1em approx 16px

rem - take browser font size and multiply it by the value of rem (for e.x 1.1rem = 1.1 * browser font size)
vmin - takes the value specified at the minimum resolution (80vmin - takes 80% of the screen width at minimum)

Property & Recommended unit 
a) font-size(root element)- Recommended units are % (100%, 50%) and another possible unit is nothing to keep it inline with browser Property
b) font-size: rem (em=>children only)
c) padding and margin - use rem 
d)border - use px
e) width & height - use % or vw/vh/vmin/vmax 
f) top & bottom - use %


margin-auto and text-align center for displaying block elements in the center 

Units - px percentages rem&em, viewport and auto 
Containing block - 
reference point when applying % units to an element 
depends on position property applied to the element 
can be closest ancestor or the viewport
